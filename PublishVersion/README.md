</details>

<details><summary>Cyan, White and Red Mobs</summary>


	Higher level monsters will have their names appear in red. Monsters within your range will be white. Monsters below your level will be cyan.  By default it is +- 10 of your current level.

	If you are significantly higher level than a monster, your XP award will be reduced. Monsters that are significantly lower level than you will have their names appear in cyan.

	Monsters that are 1 level higher than the character + MaxLevelRange will curve XP.

	With defaults, starting exp req is 500 with a 1.04 multiplayer.  So first 5 levels of experience required will be: level 1 is 500, 2 is 1020, 3 is 1560, 4 is 2122, 5 is 2707

	FirstLevelExperience used on each level: disabled means that the levels will not add 500 each time: level 1 is 520, 2 is 541, 3 is 562, 4 is 585, 5 is 608. The jsons will all have to be reworked if this is disabled

	Below is an image of 1.04 +500 and with FirstLevelExperience disabled, so no 500 added. The difference is a lot. Also 1.08 scaling is added just to show how it gets into the millions pretty quickly. 

![https://wackymole.com/hosts/epicmmolevelcalcs.png](https://wackymole.com/hosts/epicmmolevelcalcs.png)

	With Low_damage_level- Damage dealt to a higher level monster will be reduced by the difference in levels. E.g. (Character level 20/ Monster level 50 = 0.4. Damage dealt will be 0.4% of normal damage) 
	damageFactor = (float)(playerLevel + LowDamageConfig)/ monsterLevel; You can configure LowDamageConfig to adjust damage scaling up or down. Damage Factor will not go above 1 or below .1f

	All of these formulas functions can be configured in the settings file.

	Please note:
	When upgrading the mod to a newer version, new fields in the settings file will be created automatically. You will have to manually re-edit these values if you have changed them.
	If you have no custom settings in the configuration file, you should delete the file so that a fresh one can be created by the new version.

	Note for other Mods: This mod uses hit.toolTier to pass the Lvl of player and Player.m_localPlayer.m_knownTexts to store levels

</details>

</details>

</details>

<details><summary>Reset Skill Points</summary>

	There are configs for setting the Reset currency, default is Coins. You set the ammount per level.

	There is also an Item called ResetTrophy that you can spawn or add to the builtin droplist that will allow any level reset with only 1 ResetTrophy.

	The mod looks for your reset currency first and then ResetTrophies. Only consumes 1, so make this a very rare item. 

</details>

<details><summary>UI</summary>

![https://wackymole.com/hosts/CenterBar.png](https://wackymole.com/hosts/CenterBar.png)

Pretty much all of the UI can be scaled, hidden, dragged and remembers their location.

To make UI elements disappear type "none" in the respective elements color setting. 

	1HudPanelPosition: Main UI Background Panel Draggable, default color set by HudBackgroundCol, Type "none" to make it disappear

	HudBarScale: Scale this up or down to resize ALL MMO UI elements. - 1.0 Should cover all of your screen horizontally 

	2-5 UI elements have Position, Scale and Color: 
	 Scale (x, y, z)- z does not matter. - float
	 Color: #(6 digit Hex),  optional 7-8 Digit means alpha. #986100FF (FF -alpha of 1) or use without # red, cyan, blue, 
	 darkblue, lightblue, purple, yellow, lime, fuchsia, white, silver, grey, black, orange, brown, maroon, green, olive, navy, teal, aqua, magenta
	 set color to none, to hide element
	 
	 Can all be set to "none" to make individual elements disappear

	5EitrPanelPosition: Dragable, Position, Scale and Color, Can be Hidden. Will disappear and reappear when you have Eitr.

	DisabledHealthIcons: This disables the red Health Icon that is normal present under vanilla health bar

	To enable ONLY EXP bar , enable OldXPBar Bar Only and restart - not dragable in this mode, this is being slowly phased out.  No reason to use.
